The New Directions in Analyzing Text as Data (TADA) meeting is a leading forum for research on the study of politics, society, and culture through computational analysis of documents. Recent advances in NLP have the potential to revolutionize how we study human society. But using these tools effectively, reliably, and equitably requires continuous dialog between experts across computational methods, social science, and the humanities. 

TADA 2022 invites applications for research presentations on new work related to text-as-data methods and applications. TADA is an interdisciplinary conference, drawing scholars from across the social sciences, computer and information science, and related fields. Our programs from past meetings (TADA 2018, TADA 2019, and [TADA 2021](https://tada2021.org)) show the wide range of work presented at our conference.

This year's conference will be held at Cornell Tech on Roosevelt Island and is sponsored by the Cornell Center for Social Science, the Cornell Center for Data Science for Enterprise and Society, and the National Science Foundation. Events will take place at the Verizon Executive Education Center on the Cornell Tech campus.

**Accommodations** The [Graduate Hotel](https://www.graduatehotels.com/roosevelt-island/) Roosevelt Island is immediately adjacent to the conference location. Roosevelt Island is also accessible on the F train from Manhattan and Queens. Locations around Bryant Park are particularly convenient. Note that subway service may be limited after 9pm. 

Proposals are due July 18, and consist of a brief, 300-word abstract in text format rather than a full paper. TADA 2022 is a non-archival conference; there are no formal proceedings, and papers presented at the conference will not be distributed publicly by the conference. Presenters are expected to provide a paper to their discussant two weeks before the conference. We welcome any work, so long as it hasn't been previously presented at a TADA conference. We also welcome individuals to volunteer to serve as discussants.

In addition to oral presentations and posters TADA 2022 will have a doctoral consortium. PhD students will be matched with experienced mentors from complementary fields to offer critiques to specific work and to provide guidance in how to do effective interdisciplinary work.

Diversity leads to stronger science. We actively seek, welcome, and encourage people with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and identities to apply and attend. While many participants have attended TADA for years, we also eagerly welcome new researchers!
