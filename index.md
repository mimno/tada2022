## TADA 2022

At Cornell Tech, Roosevelt Island, New York City

October 6-7, 2022

TADA 2021 invites applications for participation and research presentations on new work related to text-as-data methods and applications. TADA is an interdisciplinary conference, drawing scholars from across the social sciences, computer science, and related fields. Our programs from past meetings (TADA 2018, TADA 2019, and [TADA 2021](https://tada2021.org)) show the wide range of work presented at our conference.


This year’s conference will be held at Cornell Tech on Roosevelt Island and is sponsored by the Cornell Center for Social Science.

 

Please note that each paper / poster proposal is a brief, 250-word abstract rather than a full paper. In contrast with computer science conferences, TADA 2021 is a non-archival conference; there is no formal proceedings, and papers presented at the conference will not be distributed publicly. Presenters are expected to provide a paper to their discussant two weeks before the conference. We welcome any work, so long as it hasn’t been previously presented at a TADA conference. We also welcome individuals to volunteer to serve as discussants.

 

We are planning to hold TADA 2022 in a hybrid format. Participants who are willing to travel to NYC will attend the conference in person, while a remote option will be provided for the other participants. The conference will consist of oral presentations and a poster session with Ph.D. students. The conference will take place on October 6 and 7 during Eastern Daylight Time business hours.

 

Because space is limited, we ask all interested participants to apply to attend the conference. Applicants should indicate how they intend to participate; i.e, by presenting a paper, presenting a poster, serving as a discussant, or simply attending. Each individual who might attend the conference is asked to submit a separate application; each proposed paper should be submitted exactly once by a single contact author. Individuals whose paper is being submitted by another should simply answer “no” to “Are you the Contact Author for a Paper or Poster?”.

 

We recognize that diversity leads to stronger science, and we actively seek, welcome, and encourage people with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and identities to apply and attend.

  

### Travel and Lodging

We anticipate having lodging options available for conference participants to reserve directly. Limited travel funds will be made available for the contact author of accepted papers and posters. Priority for this funding will be given to scholars who lack their own travel funds. We will provide guidance on booking rooms and accessing travel funds with your conference acceptance.
