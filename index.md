The New Directions in Analyzing Text as Data (TADA) meeting is a leading forum for research on the study of politics, society, and culture through computational analysis of documents. Recent advances in NLP have the potential to revolutionize how we study human society. But using these tools effectively, reliably, and equitably requires continuous dialog between experts across computational methods, social science, and the humanities. 

TADA 2021 invites applications for participation and research presentations on new work related to text-as-data methods and applications. TADA is an interdisciplinary conference, drawing scholars from across the social sciences, computer and information science, and related fields. Our programs from past meetings (TADA 2018, TADA 2019, and [TADA 2021](https://tada2021.org)) show the wide range of work presented at our conference.

This yearâ€™s conference will be held at Cornell Tech on Roosevelt Island and is sponsored by the Cornell Center for Social Science.

Proposals are due July 18, and  is a brief, 300-word abstract rather than a full paper. In contrast with computer science conferences, TADA 2021 is a non-archival conference; there are no formal proceedings, and papers presented at the conference will not be distributed publicly. Presenters are expected to provide a paper to their discussant two weeks before the conference. We welcome any work, so long as it hasn't been previously presented at a TADA conference. We also welcome individuals to volunteer to serve as discussants.

We are planning to hold TADA 2022 in a hybrid format. Participants who are willing to travel to NYC will attend the conference in person, while a remote option will be provided for the other participants. The conference will consist of oral presentations and a poster session with Ph.D. students. The conference will take place on October 6 and 7 during Eastern Daylight Time business hours.

In addition to oral presentations and posters TADA 2022 will have a doctoral consortium. PhD students will be matched with experienced mentors from complementary fields to offer critiques to specific work and to provide guidance in how to do effective interdisciplinary work.

Because in-person space is limited, we ask all interested participants to apply to attend the conference. Applicants should indicate how they intend to participate; i.e, by presenting a paper, presenting a poster, serving as a discussant, or simply attending. Each individual who might attend the conference is asked to submit a separate application; each proposed paper should be submitted exactly once by a single contact author. There will be a separate registration for participants.

Diversity leads to stronger science. We actively seek, welcome, and encourage people with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and identities to apply and attend. While many participants have attended TADA for years, we also eagerly welcome new researchers!

We anticipate having lodging options available for conference participants to reserve directly. Limited travel funds will be made available for the contact author of accepted papers and posters. Priority for this funding will be given to scholars who lack their own travel funds. We will provide guidance on booking rooms and accessing travel funds with your conference acceptance.
